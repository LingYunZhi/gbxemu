These scripts in conjunction with dpgmux allow fast and easy
compression of your video files for use with MoonShell.

Before you can use these scripts, download the latest ffmpeg
from http://ffdshow.faireal.net/mirror/ffmpeg/

Uncompress the executable to a directory mentioned in your PATH variable,
for example to C:\Windows\System32

The scripts are now easily usable:
Just drop a video file onto 'encode_video_#_#.cmd' (select correct aspect)
and drop an audio file onto 'encode_audio_###.cmd' (decide which you prefer).
When ffmpeg is finished, there will be two files in your C:\ directory:
'out.m1v' (MPEG-1 Video) and 'out.mp2' (MPEG-1 Audio Layer 2).

To create a playable DPG file, just select those two files and
drag and drop them onto 'dpgmux.exe'. It will create 'out.dpg'.

Rename the DPG file as you wish and copy it to your Nintendo DS.
