Here is a short overview over the top level folders of the VisualBoyAdvance 2 source code:


"build"
Contains the project file for the Qt build system.
I recommend opening it with the Qt Creator IDE that comes with the Qt SDK.
The compiled binaries will also end up there.


"doc"
Contains documentation meant for the end user, like the license agreement and a readme file.


"doxygen"
Contains documentation targeted at developers.
It will be automatically extracted from the source code using the  Doxygen tool ( http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/ ).


"gba2"
Contains the source code related to emulating a Game Boy Advance.
Any connections to elements of the graphical user interface are strictly forbidden.


"vba2"
Contains the source code and resources related to the graphical user interface.
It makes use of the functionality in the "gba2" folder to create a ready-to-use emulator application.
