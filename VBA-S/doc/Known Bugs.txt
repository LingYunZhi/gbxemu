- Linking: Doesnt work quite right yet.

- Audio core: assertation error occurs when disabling sound in GB mode
 - I think its best we mute sound instead, since some games rely on audio for timing.
   Plus, blargg's GB_Snd_Emu is extremely optimized stuff. (Mudlord)
 - blargg's core implementation broke Dwedit's GBC emu.

- Wrong bit depth image is displayed for 2 frames when switching from/to HQ3x/4x ASM
 - This is caused by the 16bit hack which does not re-process the emulated image.
   It results in the display devices treating the image at pix with the wrong bit depth.
