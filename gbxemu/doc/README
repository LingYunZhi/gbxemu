Per game settings
-----------------

Version 1.5 introduced the support for per game settings for GBA games. You
can defined the following settings on a per game basis by using an INI file
called vba-over.ini in the same directory as the emulator:

rtcEnabled=<0 for false, anything else for true>
flashSize=<65536 or 131072>
saveType=<0 for automatic, 1 for EEPROM, 2 for SRAM, 3 for Flash or 4 for
EEPROM+Sensor>

Use the 4 letter game code to separate settings for each game. Example:

[ABCD]
rtcEnabled=0
flashSize=65536
saveType=0

[ABC2]
rtcEnabled=1
flashSize=131072
saveType=0
