How to compile the source
-------------------------

Visual C++
----------

This requires Microsoft Visual C++ 2003 or greater.
Just open the solution file at gbxemu/windows/gba_sdl.sln
Select either Debug or Release and compile it.
Copy the dll files from gbxemu/windows/dll either
to the folder where gbxemu's compiled binary was created
or into your WINDOWS/system32 folder.
